A simple utility to help you pack and manage texture atlases for [LibGDX game framework](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
It's mostly just a visual wrapper over [LibGDX TexturePacker classes](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Texture-packer)
and provides a convenient way to use it.

This project is a successor of [Aurelien Ribon's application](http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/2012/06/texturepacker-gui-support-for-multiple-packs/) with the whole new GUI and features.
